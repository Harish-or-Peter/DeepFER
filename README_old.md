---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 0 — PROJECT SETUP
0.1 Repo & folder scaffold
Goal: Reproducible local project using your existing Drive-like structure.
Actions: Create VS Code workspace; init Git; create DeepFER_Project structure; add README, requirements.txt, .gitignore, config.yaml.
Deliverables: Clean repo with folders: data/raw|processed|metadata, notebooks, scripts, models, results, docs, etc.
Accept: Repo clones and runs “pip install -r requirements.txt” without errors.

0.2 Environment & GPU check
Goal: Stable Python env with CUDA (if available).
Actions: Create venv/conda; install torch/tf, torchvision/opencv, sklearn, albumentations, onnxruntime, tensorboard; verify GPU.
Deliverables: environment.yml or requirements.txt; “python -c ‘import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())’” returns True if GPU present.
Accept: Training script can see GPU; CPU fallback works.

0.3 Config & logging
Goal: Centralized config and logging for reproducibility.
Actions: Create config.yaml (paths, image_size, batch_size, lr, epochs); set up Python logging + TensorBoard.
Deliverables: scripts/utils/config.py, scripts/utils/logger.py; runs produce logs and TB events in results/.
Accept: One-line config change updates training without code edits.

PHASE 1 — DATA PIPELINE
1.1 Dataset ingestion
Goal: Place or download datasets into data/raw.
Actions: Copy FER datasets; store label map in data/metadata/classes.json; verify class counts.
Deliverables: data/raw with train/val/test; classes.json with 7 labels.
Accept: Sanity script prints counts per class and sample paths.

1.2 Data integrity audit
Goal: Clean, complete data.
Actions: Detect/remove corrupt images, duplicates, zero-sized files; handle class imbalance summary.
Deliverables: results/metrics/data_audit.json and CSV with per-class stats.
Accept: No corrupt files; clear imbalance report with proposed remedies.

1.3 Preprocessing & augmentation
Goal: Deterministic transforms for train/val/test.
Actions: Build dataset class/dataloader with resize, center-crop; training-only augmentations (flip, rotate, color jitter, cutout optional).
Deliverables: scripts/data_preprocessing.py; cached samples in data/processed if needed.
Accept: Dataloader yields batches fast; visual sanity grid saved in results/predictions/sample_augs.jpg.

PHASE 2 — BASELINES & EXPERIMENTS
2.1 Simple CNN baseline
Goal: Establish a floor metric.
Actions: Train a small CNN from scratch for 5–10 epochs.
Deliverables: models/checkpoints/baseline.pt; results/metrics/baseline.json; curves.
Accept: Trains end-to-end; accuracy > random; metrics captured.

2.2 Transfer learning v1 (ResNet-50 or EfficientNet-B0)
Goal: Quick accuracy lift.
Actions: Load ImageNet backbone; freeze; add GAP+Dropout+Dense(7); train head then fine-tune top layers.
Deliverables: models/checkpoints/tl_v1.pt; results/metrics/tl_v1.json; confusion matrix.
Accept: +5–15% over baseline; stable training without overfit spike.

2.3 Model selection sweep
Goal: Pick best backbone for speed/accuracy.
Actions: Run short trials on MobileNetV2, EfficientNet-B3, ResNet-50; same config.
Deliverables: results/metrics/model_sweep.csv with accuracy/F1/params/FPS.
Accept: Clear winner chosen with rationale.

PHASE 3 — TRAINING OPTIMIZATION
3.1 Hyperparameter tuning
Goal: Improve generalization and convergence.
Actions: Tune lr, weight decay, batch size, dropout, augment strength, label smoothing; Optuna or manual grid.
Deliverables: results/metrics/hparam_trials.csv; best_config.yaml.
Accept: Statistically meaningful gain (e.g., +1–3% macro-F1) and stable curves.

3.2 Regularization & class imbalance
Goal: Robustness across classes.
Actions: Try balanced sampling, focal loss, mixup/cutmix; early stopping; cosine LR schedule with warmup.
Deliverables: updated training script; plots; per-class metrics.
Accept: Per-class recall increases on minority classes without tanking overall metrics.

3.3 Checkpointing & resume
Goal: Safe long runs.
Actions: Save best and last checkpoints; resume training mid-run; seed everything.
Deliverables: models/checkpoints/*.pt, scripts support --resume.
Accept: Resume reproduces metrics trajectory within tolerance.

PHASE 4 — EVALUATION & INTERPRETABILITY
4.1 Comprehensive evaluation
Goal: Trustworthy metrics.
Actions: Compute accuracy, precision, recall, macro-F1; ROC per class if applicable; confusion matrix; calibration check.
Deliverables: results/metrics/final_eval.json; confusion_matrix.png; classification_report.txt.
Accept: Numbers match validation loop; plots readable and saved.

4.2 Robustness tests
Goal: Real-world reliability.
Actions: Test on varied lighting, occlusions, rotations; mild blur/noise; report sensitivity.
Deliverables: results/metrics/robustness.json with deltas vs clean set.
Accept: Degradation quantified; selected mitigations documented in results.

4.3 Explainability
Goal: Interpret predictions.
Actions: Grad-CAM/Score-CAM on representative images; analyze failure cases.
Deliverables: results/predictions/gradcam/*.png; brief notes in results/reports/interp_notes.txt.
Accept: Heatmaps focus on relevant facial regions; insights feed back to training choices.

PHASE 5 — REAL-TIME INFERENCE
5.1 Face detection pipeline
Goal: Reliable face crops.
Actions: Implement Mediapipe or OpenCV DNN face detector; track FPS and detection rate; margin/align faces.
Deliverables: scripts/realtime/face_detector.py; sample video with boxes.
Accept: >95% detection on test clips; stable under moderate motion.

5.2 Streaming inference loop
Goal: Low-latency emotion predictions.
Actions: VideoCapture → detect → preprocess → model → softmax → smoothing (temporal median) → overlay label/prob.
Deliverables: scripts/realtime/app.py; demo video saved to results/predictions/demo.mp4.
Accept: ≥20–30 FPS on your hardware; latency <100 ms per frame path if GPU; accurate overlays.

5.3 Performance optimization
Goal: Production-speed path.
Actions: TorchScript or ONNX export; run with ONNX Runtime or TensorRT if NVIDIA GPU; batch=1 throughput test.
Deliverables: models/export/model.onnx; results/metrics/latency_benchmark.csv.
Accept: ≥30% latency reduction vs eager; identical outputs within tolerance.


OPTIONAL EXTENSIONS (IF TIME PERMITS)
A) Domain adaptation: fine-tune on your own collected faces for better in-the-wild performance.
B) Quantization: post-training dynamic/int8 quant with ONNX Runtime/TensorRT; measure accuracy drop.
C) Ensembling: lightweight ensemble of two backbones for tough classes.
